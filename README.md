I built a dynamic web application using Django that analyzes a fast-food restaurant's menu dataset. The project integrates data visualization, user authentication, and AI-powered calorie prediction to help users explore healthier food options.

Objective:

To help users analyze and visualize nutritional information of food items from a fast-food menu and provide smart calorie predictions using AI.

Steps Performed:

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on menu items using pandas and plotly.
Built interactive charts (bar, pie, scatter) to visualize calorie, fat, and protein distributions.
Developed an AI-powered predictor using Linear Regression to estimate calories based on ingredients.
Added user login/signup authentication and protected routes using Djangoâ€™s auth system.
Enabled category-based filtering and calorie range search on the dashboard and data tables.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python, Django, HTML/CSS (Tailwind)
Pandas, NumPy, Plotly
scikit-learn for machine learning
Django Templates, User Auth, Form Handling

Outcome:

Successfully deployed an intelligent, user-friendly web dashboard
Gained experience in combining AI, data analysis, and web development
Improved performance and usability using category filters and visual analytics
